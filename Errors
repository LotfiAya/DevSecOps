🛠️ Error Report - Kubernetes Deployment on Ubuntu 20.04

1️⃣ Version Compatibility
❌ Problem:
During installation, we encountered a compatibility issue due to using different versions of Docker and Kubernetes across machines. This prevented Kubernetes from functioning properly.
✅ Solution:
We resolved this by ensuring that all machines use the same versions of Docker and Kubernetes.

 2️⃣ Network Connection (Access Point)
 ❌ Problem:
- The connection of the bridge with the Euromed University Wi-Fi network caused issues, preventing us from accessing the network.
- Some machines did not display an IP address.
 ✅ Solution:
We connected the bridge to an access point, which stabilized the connection and resolved the IP address display issues.

 3️⃣ Kubelet Issue on Worker Machine
 ❌ Problem:
 The kubelet service was not running on the worker node.
 ✅ Solution:
We first joined the worker machine to the master. After the jointure, kubelet started running properly.

 4️⃣ Jointure Issues
 🔹 4.1 Jointure to the Master Failure
 ❌ Problem:
The worker failed to join the master due to a misconfiguration in the **/etc/containerd/config.toml** file.
 ✅ Solution:
We reconfigured the `config.toml` file. However, this configuration varies between machines, so adjustments must be made according to the specific environment.

 🔹 4.2 Certificate Issue
 ❌ Problem:
A certificate error occurred when joining the worker to the cluster.
 ✅ Solution:
[To be completed based on the applied fix]
